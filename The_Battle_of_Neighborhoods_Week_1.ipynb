    "Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, is a city with more than 10 million habitants, it is the main economic center of the country. It is the Colombian city with the largest number of foreign companies, one of the factors that position it as the largest labor market in its country. Bogotá is the largest business platform in Colombia, with 21% of the companies registered in the country, and additionally, 67% of Colombian high-impact enterprises are located in the city. Bogotá one of the five most attractive Latin American capitals to invest\n",

    "In spite of being a very populated capital, it is one of the few in the world that for the amount of habitants it has not  a massive transport like the subway. Until this year 2020 begins the first works. That is why in the medium term economic growth is planned at all levels.\n",
